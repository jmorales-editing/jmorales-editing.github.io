My path started on YouTube with the channel, John Writing, in which I aimed to document my journey to become a novelist, but after a 18 months I'd learned that I loved storytelling through video editing more than finding just the right words. And that love has lead me to editing projects for clients and for my own enjoyment.</p>

		                    <p class="lead">I grew up in a Sunday-Mass home, we attended mass weekly, but we didn't pray, read scripture, or truly follow after Christ. So when I entered my rebellious phase as a teen, the natural place to rebel was against the traditions that no one seemed to take very seriously anyway. I stopped going to mass at around thirteen years old and became a child of the world. <br><br>But God, in His infinite goodness had compassion on me, and while I continually struggled and suffered much outside of His care, His loving hand never left me, and He slowly drew me back to Himself. Although, my idea of morals was corrupted by my own self-will, God continually showed me examples of Christians who lived in a higher way than me. Finally, in Spring of 2023, God gave me the grace to attend a small non-denominational service. This first sermon and worship music stirred my soul with consolation and I began attending regularly. I joined a bible study and met some people who were truly committed to living out the message of Charity toward their neighbors. They were so kind to me and showed me such love, but in December of 2023, I started feeling the pull toward tradition.<br><br>Knowing my baggage toward Catholicism, God showed His patience once again and exposed me first to Eastern Orthodoxy. He showed me the beauty of traditions stretching back since the time of Christ, and I found I agreed more and more with the Orthodox teachings rather than the Southern Baptist teachings of my bible study family. But even more, God placed in my soul a longing for the Sacraments and especially the Holy Eucharist.<br><br>I didn't want to stop going to church with my non-denominational friends, and struggled with going back and forth on this decision for months. But eventually the pull toward the Sacraments was too strong and I attended a Greek Orthodox Divine Liturgy. The Liturgy itself was very beautiful, but the community was much older than me and culturally Greek. I felt like an outsider. With this option looking less appealing in my mind, God was ready to draw me toward His Church. <br><br>At this time, God gave me the grace to encounter more Catholic sources (Father Mike Schmitz, Brian Holdsworth, Matt Fradd, and others). Hearing the clarity with which these Catholics spoke reminded me very much of the Eastern Orthodox speakers I'd heard. I was still skeptical when they spoke of the Catholic Church being the Church Christ founded, but these little seeds landed in the fertile soil of a soul longing for the Eucharist. And soon I decided to attend mass for the first time in fifteen years.<br><br>As I sat down in one of the pews, my heart was split in three directions. There was Eastern Orthodoxy with it's appeal of a very reverent liturgy. There were the wonderful Protestant friends and their familial environment. And as I sat down among a large parish of young families, undergrad and graduate students, middle-aged parents and their teens, and white-haired elders, the draw back to the Church grew stronger. I was so unsure of what to do, so I prayed.<br><br>I asked God for a sign of whether or not I should keep giving the Catholic Church a chance. And during the mass I got it.<br><br>More than ever before, I felt that God was present with us. And God sought to stir my soul in many ways during this mass: the beautiful domed architecture captured my imagination, the traditional choir sung beautiful chants and hymns, and the incense floated toward the heavens carrying our prayers to the Father. But most of all, as the priest said the words of consecration, my eyes were glued to the little Host being raised in his hands. <br><br>My Lord and my God.<br><br>The next Saturday, I went to my first confession in twenty years. And the next Sunday, in April 2024, I was reunited with Jesus in the Eucharist for the first time in fifteen years. Since then I've delved deeply into apologetics to strengthen my faith, cultivated a relationship with the Blessed Virgin Mary through the Rosary, have gone through Father Mike's Catechism in the Year, have read through more than three-quarters of the bible for the first time, and am now going through OCIA to be confirmed at Easter.<br><br>The Lord is truly gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love. And it is such a grace to be rentering His Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.</p>
