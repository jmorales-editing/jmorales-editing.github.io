		                    <p>I created this title and thumbnail as part of a proposal for the Cordial Catholic channel, reworking the thumbnail and title one of his recent videos which underperformed.<br><br>The target audience includes Catholics who question if Catholicism is just another denomination and Protestants who may be wondering if it is something more.<br><br>With that in mind, the title is meant to appeal to confirmation bias from both sides of the audience.<br><br>For Catholics, it affirms what they already believe, while prompting curiosity to better understand the arguments for their faith in light of Protestant objections.<br><br>For Protestants, it challenges their beliefs and suggests they might be missing something important.<br><br>The thumbnail reinforces the title by getting more specific about the question at hand: "Is Catholicism just another denomination?"<br><br>It also hints at an answer through the visual contrast: Notre Dame appears in color, while buildings of various denominations are in black and white—reinforcing the confirmation bias appeal for both sides.</p>

		                        The target audience for this video was people familiar with St. Therese, who perhaps had read her "Story of a Soul", but may have overlooked the depth of her spirituality.<br><br>The title was meant to challenge viewer's assumptions and make them question whether they truly understand her.<br><br>The thumbnail aims to complement this message, hinting at a deeper truth revealed by her death.<br><br>I created this video as a personal project on a channel with no videos. I wasn't expecting many views, but still wanted to give it the chance to spread, if God willed to use it.</p>

		                    <p>The target audience for this video was people who had watched the Netflix series "Squid Games: the Challenge". The client, a contestant on the show, wanted to tell her story. Since it was her first video, production took longer than expected, and we missed peak of the trend. So we aimed to create something more evergreen that would be interesting even without knowing the show's context.<br><br>The title is leans into spectacle, highlighting the scale of the show. Since it was the largest reality show Netflix organized, the claim is accurate. Also it uses minimal characters, making it well suited to grabbing attention on the YouTube homepage.<br><br>The thumbnail hints at the show referenced in the title and lends credibility to its bold claim. The text "me" is placed on a rule-of-thirds intersection to draw the viewer's eye, with the arrow guiding their eyes to the client.<br><br>We deliberately chose not to magnify her face, keeping the image closer to a raw screenshot to enhance authenticity.</p>

		                    <p>
		                        The target audience is people broadly interested in St. Therese, including those who've learned about her but dismissed her as "too girly" or "too sentimental."<br><br>The title is meant to evoke the mysterious complexity of Therese, with "paradox" suggesting qualities impossible to reconcile—an idea reinforced by the thumbnail.<br><br>The thumbnail represents the two sides of Therese: the "little soul" unable to climb the stairway to perfection, and the towering saint sometimes viewed as impossibly holy. These reflect two common ways her spirituality is dismissed: either as too simple to be true or too demanding to attempt.<br><br>This video isn't finished yet, so I can't say for sure whether this title and thumbnail will stay the same. But it gives a good sense of how I approach the ideation and marketing before making the video.<br></p>
