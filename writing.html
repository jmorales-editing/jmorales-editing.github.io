On June 5th, 1897, St. Therese said four of the most perplexing words she ever uttered. Her health had rapidly declined and her physical suffering had grown deeper than ever. Her spiritual trial, which had plagued her for more than a year with temptations toward doubt and despair, continued to tell her death would be followed by nothingness. And yet, it is in this moment, when her suffering had reached a new peak that she says the words “Everything is a grace”
                        <br><br>
And these seemingly paradoxical words contain in them a deep lesson that if properly practiced, has the capacity to make every practitioner a saint.
                        <br><br>
But how do we begin to understand this mysterious lesson? To find the answer, we must look not to her deathbed, but to one of her greatest trials: her father’s illness.
                        <br><br>
And this terrible trial reveals to us four foundational dispositions that enabled Therese to draw good from this agonizing period. The first of these dispositions is blind trust. 
                        <br><br>
—
                        <br><br>
On April 9th, 1888, St. Therese entered the Lisieux Carmel. Her father had already suffered from multiple bouts of localized paralysis, but she was consoled by the fact that his care would be in her sister Celine’s capable hands. However, only two months later, on June 23rd, this consolation was ripped away from Therese.
                        <br><br>
Her father had suddenly disappeared from their home and no one knew where he could be. With much prayer and four days of agonizing wait, he was finally found in the city Le Havre, repeating that he wanted to live as a hermit. But Therese’s uncle Isidore and sister Celine could both tell he was not himself. 
                        <br><br>
The source of his mental confusion was a combination of physical and emotional factors. He had been suffering from progressive arteriosclerosis and a serious kidney disease. On top of that, Celine and Leonie, his last daughters living with him, had told him of their eventual plans to enter contemplative religious life. 
                        <br><br>
During this disappearance, Therese and her sisters could only pray that he would be found. And it is in this moment of pain and confusion that Therese writes the following to Celine:
                        <br><br>
 “Where is He [Jesus], why does He not come to console us, since we have no Friend but Him? Alas! He is not far off. He is here, close, looking at us, begging us to offer Him this grief, this agony... He needs it for souls, for our soul: He means to give us so splendid a reward!”
                        <br><br>
In this moment when it would be easy to question, why is this happening to us? St. Therese responds instead with blind trust. Even though Jesus feels far away, she trusts that He is close. And not only that He is present, but that he is working for their good even in this suffering. It’s an act of trust in God’s infinite goodness.
                        <br><br>
And this sort of blind trust is exactly what we as fallen humans need, to recover a proper relationship with God. As the Catechism says:
                        <br><br>
“Man, tempted by the devil, let his trust in his Creator die in his heart and, abusing his freedom, disobeyed God’s command. This is what man’s first sin consisted of. All subsequent sin would be disobedience toward God and lack of trust in his goodness.” (CCC 397)
                        <br><br>
Because of the sin of our first parents, our trust in God and his goodness was wounded. And this lack of trust is what causes us to struggle to follow God’s commands, so restoring right relationship to God requires us to regain this trust.
                        <br><br>
But Therese’s journey toward blind trust was not easy. She grew up in a France that still suffered from Jansenistic ways of seeing God. Jansenism is heresy which denies man’s participation in his salvation through the exercise of free will and emphasizes a rigorist and fearful approach toward God’s Justice. And although this heresy was condemned in the 1600s, this fearful view of God still saturated Therese’s environment.
                        <br><br>
During her childhood, she had multiple retreats with Fr. Domin all focused on the fierce Justice of God, with conferences on topics including: Hell, the Last Judgment, Sacrilegious Communion, and Mortal Sin. But even in this fearful environment Jesus was guiding Therese to trust.
                        <br><br>
When she received her first communion she was overwhelmed with His love and goodness. This experience, so different from the teachings she’d heard, was a little seed of trust planted in her. 
                        <br><br>
And God nurtured the little seed continually by showing Therese her own weakness and supporting her Himself. When she became deathly ill as a child, she was cured through the Blessed Virgin’s smile. When she struggled as a child with scruples, she received relief through prayer to her siblings in heaven. When she was hampered by oversensitivity for over a decade, God himself freed her of this infirmity on Christmas. The message, to place all her trust in God.
                        <br><br>
And these first flowerings of blind trust, nurtured even more in the soil of Carmel, resulted in a complete restoration of her trust in God’s goodness. And the best example of this trust is found at the very end of her Autobiography, where Therese writes:
                        <br><br>
“Yes, I feel it; even though I had on my conscience all the sins that can be committed, I would go, my heart broken with sorrow, and throw myself into Jesus’s arms, for I know how much He loves the prodigal child who returns to Him.”
                        <br><br>
This blind trust allowed Therese to see God's graces as they truly are, undeserved gifts. But the next disposition allowed Therese to see even suffering as a gift of God: embracing fire. 
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
After the “triumph” of a sick Louis Martin of appearing at Therese’s clothing day in January of 1889, his condition rapidly deteriorated. He started to hear the sounds of battles and screams of slaughter in his mind; and began to carry a revolver to defend his family. And on February 12th, 1889, after finally being disarmed by Uncle Isidore, her father was placed in a mental institution. 
                        <br><br>
And in this moment of helplessness and suffering, Therese embraces the refining fire sent by God, saying in a letter to Celine:
                        <br><br>
“Ah! darling Sister, far from complaining to Jesus of the cross He sends us, I cannot fathom the infinite love which has brought Him to treat us so. Our dearest father must indeed be loved by Jesus, to have to suffer like this!”
                        <br><br>
These words can be hard to understand for many. They seem so contrary to our natures, which are repulsed by suffering. But Therese sees it differently. She sees it as a sign of Jesus’s love for them, a gift meant to purify them and draw them closer to God.
                        <br><br>
To understand this mindset so foreign to our fallen nature, we need look no further than two of Therese’s greatest spiritual influences. The first was so central to her thought that she had nearly memorized it as a child: her beloved Imitation of Christ. And it is in this text that we find the following attitude toward suffering:
                        <br><br>
“Nothing is more acceptable to God, nothing more salutary for yourself… than that you should cheerfully suffer for Christ…for by suffering you would be made more like unto Christ.”After Effects must have keyframes selected in order to export them as text.
                        <br><br>
Suffering is not to be feared, but instead cheerfully embraced as the most profitable means for working out our salvation. And in the next great spiritual influence on Therese, we see that suffering serves a specific purpose in our spiritual lives. In Fr. Arminjon’s The End of this Present World and the Mysteries of the Life to Come, he says the following about suffering:
                        <br><br>
“This pain, by crushing us in its grip, tears us away from love of present things… In the fire of tribulation, all the wealth and all the goods for which we yearned so ardently appear as they really are, and become in our eyes, mere smoke and empty shadows”
                        <br><br>
The refining fires God sends to us, help us detach from created things, and see them as they really are. And Therese comments on the value of these refining fires in her Autobiography, where she says:
                        <br><br>
“Later on when perfection was set before me, I understood that to become a saint one had to suffer much… I understood, too, there were many degrees of perfection and each soul was free to respond to the advances of Our Lord, to do little or much for Him, in a word, to choose among the sacrifices He was asking. Then, as in the days of my childhood, I cried out: “My God ‘I choose all!’ I don’t want to be a saint by halves.”
                        <br><br>
Therese wanted to love Jesus as much as she could. But she also knew that as the fallen creatures we are, our attachments to anything but God keep us from being able to love Him perfectly. But Jesus is not content with just part of our hearts, He is not content with imperfect love, and He desires to free us from these attachments so we can love Him fully and experience the joy of being united to Him.
                        <br><br>
And these attachments can only be burned away through the refining fires Jesus grants us. And so St. Therese, not wanting to be a ‘saint by halves’ decided to choose all; to embrace all the refining fires Jesus gave her, knowing that they were great gifts to draw her closer to Him. And knowing that only through embracing these fires, could she truly love Him perfectly.
                        <br><br>
For this reason St. Therese saw suffering as a gift from God, but she could only see suffering as a grace because of the next disposition: Eternal Focus
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
On March 12th, 1889, a full month since her father had been placed in a mental institution, things hadn’t improved. Her sisters Leonie and Celine were now further separated from those in the convent, staying in a monastery in Caen to be close to their father. 
                        <br><br>
And yet back in Lisieux, gossip had been circulating about their father’s decline. And these rumors even spread from town into the convent and were discussed in front of Therese. Perhaps the most bitter of these rumors was the speculation that Louis Martin’s mental decline was caused by Therese leaving home. But with all the pain of this present life before her, Therese focused instead on the eternal reality writing to Celine:
                        <br><br>
“This evening, I feel a need to plunge with my Celine into the infinite… Life passes… eternity comes to meet us with great strides. Soon we shall be living with the very life of Jesus.”
                        <br><br>
For Therese to bear with the sufferings of life, she needed a perspective not focused on this present world, but instead looking to eternity. And in doing so, she was following the teaching of St. Paul from 2 Corinthians where he writes:
                        <br><br>
“For this slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, because we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen; for the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.”
                        <br><br>
Therese didn’t focus on the things seen in this present life, but the unseen things of eternity. And especially, her focus was on heaven, which was for her the guiding light that put all present sufferings in context. And her deep longing for heaven was most strongly cultivated by reading End of this Present World, in fact, this next passage was so influential on Therese that she quotes it five times when writing to Celine during their Father’s illness:
                        <br><br>
“The Lord cannot forget that the saints, when they once lived on earth, paid homage to Him by the total donation of… their whole being…In His gratitude, God exclaims: ‘Now it is My turn! The saints have made Me the gift of themselves: can I respond other than by giving Myself, without restriction or measure?... If I bring My servants and friends into My house, if I console them and make them thrill with joy by enfolding them in the embrace of My charity, this satisfies their thirst and their desires superabundantly, and is more than the perfect repose of their hearts requires; but it is not enough for the gratification of My divine Heart, for… the perfect satisfaction of My Love. I must be the soul of their souls, I must penetrate and imbue them with my Divinity… I must unite Myself to them, face to face, eternally, by showing myself to their spirits undisguised and unveiled”
                        <br><br>
This eternal joy, loving perfectly and being loved perfectly, was what Therese longed for and in the context of this joy, the passing sorrows of this life seemed well worth the reward. 
                        <br><br>
And recognizing God's eternal plan for her even in suffering helped Therese see the great graces God was granting her. And Therese received these gifts with our next disposition: Unconditional thanks.
                        <br><br>
—
                        <br><br>
On May 12th of 1892, after Uncle Isidore had brought his brother-in-law home, Therese and her Carmelite sisters were able to see their father again for the first time in four years. But thirty-nine long months in an asylum had changed their dear father. Once so sturdy and dignified, he had become gaunt and had declined cognitively; now nearly mute, and only speaking in short common phrases. The meeting was heartbreaking for Therese. 
                        <br><br>
As their father left them with tears in his eyes, he pointed upwards and managed to say “In heaven”. His words would prove true. This was the last time Therese saw her father.
                        <br><br>
But it is even in sufferings like this that Therese saw the opportunity to thank God. As she prayed in her Act of Oblation to Merciful Love:
                        <br><br>
“I thank you, O My God! for all the graces you have granted me, especially the grace of making me pass through the crucible of suffering.”
                        <br><br>
In both trial and joy Therese saw the opportunity to thank God. And this unconditional thanks is exactly what all Catholics are called to practice. That’s why so often in the mass the priest prays: 
                        <br><br>
“It is truly right and just, our duty and our salvation, always and everywhere to give you thanks, Lord, Holy Father, Almighty and Eternal God, through Christ our Lord.” 
                        <br><br>
We’re called to give thanks always and everywhere, because in every circumstance God is sustaining us and has given us everything we have.
                        <br><br>
And when thanks comes from a place of poverty, it is brought to its perfection. It becomes an act of surrender and of grateful trust in God’s providence. St. Therese puts it beautifully in her Autobiography:
                        <br><br>
“Jesus does not demand great actions from us but simply surrender and gratitude.”
                        <br><br>
In moments of trial, in our weakness and poverty, we often can’t offer great actions. But we can offer a heart that thanks even when it doesn’t understand. And this internal act to thank God even in our weakness and confusion is what He really wants from us. Because these internal acts are how we give Him our hearts. They allow us to say with Jesus, “not my will, but thy will be done.” They allow us to say with Job, “The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.”
                        <br><br>
And this is perhaps the hardest thing for us to do in moments of suffering; when all our present life seems to be pressing down upon us. But St. Therese shows us we don’t need to be perfect, we just need to do our best.
                        <br><br>
One time when she had a severe fever and terrible thirst, the infirmarian applied treatments that made her even hotter, prompting Therese to complain:
                        <br><br>
“My Jesus, You are my witness, I am burning, and they bring me still more heat and fire! Ah! If only I had in place of all this a glass of water!.. My Jesus, your little girl is very thirsty! However, she’s happy to find the opportunity of lacking what is necessary in order to resemble You better and to save souls.”
                        <br><br>
We see by Therese’s example that we don’t need to be perfect. We can be honest in our prayer and even complain to God like she did here, but when we realize what we are doing, we, like St. Therese, have the choice to see how our current situation is a gift from God, and thank him.
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
The terrible trial of her father’s illness helped Therese cultivate the four dispositions that illuminate her four mysterious words.
                        <br><br>
That day on June 5th, 1897, she was so convinced of her approaching death that she said to her sister Pauline:
                        <br><br>
“Little Mother, it’s you who prepared me for my First Communion; prepare me now for my death…”
                        <br><br>
And  it is in this place on death’s door, amidst her great trial of Faith, that Therese said to Pauline:
                        <br><br>
“If you find me dead one morning, don’t be troubled; it is because Papa, God, will have come to get me. Without a doubt, it’s a great grace to receive the sacraments; but when God doesn’t allow it, it’s good just the same; everything is a grace.”
                        <br><br>
Grace is God’s free and undeserved help; a gift that draws us to Him and prepares us for eternal life. So when Therese says these words, she is recognizing the gift that God is giving her.
                        <br><br>
By trusting blindly in God’s goodness, embracing His refining fires, focusing on the eternal, and thanking Him for all He gave her, Therese could see that everything—even suffering—was a grace.
                        <br><br>
Let us follow  after this little soul and great saint. Let us throw ourselves into the arms of Jesus full of blind trust. Let us say, “I choose all”, and embrace each refining fire God sends as a gift to purify our love. Let us focus on the unseen things of eternity, knowing the joy God desires to give us. Let us thank the God who gives us everything—always and everywhere.
                        <br><br>
Let us always be at peace, knowing with our whole hearts that Everything is a grace.

		                    St. Therese of Lisieux is indisputably one of the most beloved saints in modern times. Her Autobiography “The Story of a Soul” has sold hundreds of millions of copies. The out-of-the-way Lisieux Basilica receives more than two million pilgrims each year. And she has been named co-patroness of France with St. Joan of Arc, co-patroness of missions with St. Francis Xavier, and a Doctor of the Church.
                        <br><br>
But despite her widespread appeal, St. Therese is often misunderstood. Many see her life through a romanticized lens: a saintly childhood, a dramatic trip to Rome, a swift entry into religious life, and an early death to be with her Divine Spouse.
                        <br><br>
And this idealized view can lead readers of her Autobiography to form misconceptions about her. Her frequent use of the word “little” in describing everything can make her seem childish. Her abundant love and gratitude can make her spiritual journey seem overly-sentimental. And her description of the “little way” as an “elevator to heaven” can make her spirituality seem easy.
                        <br><br>
But to stop with these surface impressions is to miss out on the profound lessons her life and spirituality offer. To truly understand St. Therese, one must remove the romanticized lens and look directly at the intense sufferings revealed by her greatest trial: her final illness.
                        <br><br>

Suffering from Tuberculosis, St. Therese often struggled to breathe, was frequently exhausted, and was wasting away. But even worse than her physical suffering was the spiritual. Therese had always leaned on her Faith and Hope in previous trials, but in her final trial of faith, she was tormented by atheistic temptations and a feeling that God had abandoned her.
                        <br><br>
And for a self-proclaimed “little soul” to persist in faith despite such harrowing suffering, St. Therese needed to use everything Jesus had revealed to her; her little way.
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
But before diving right into the story of this trial and the secrets it unearths, it’s necessary to recognize what the “little way” is not. And St. Therese reveals this to her sister Pauline.
                        <br><br>
During her final illness, Pauline said she must have been through many struggles to reach such perfection. 
St. Therese denied this claim, adding, “Holiness does not consist in this or that practice; it consists in a disposition of the heart, which makes us always humble and little in the arms of God, well aware of our feebleness, but boldly confident in the Father’s goodness.”
                        <br><br>
For St. Therese holiness is a disposition, not some specific practices. And the “little way” too is not a roadmap to holiness, but a disposition of the heart which attracts God’s graces into one’s life and makes one holy.
And this disposition consists of five fundamental elements exemplified by Therese during this last trial.
                        <br><br>
The first aspect of the “little way” is humility. And even at the start of her final illness St. Therese demonstrates the humility God gave her.
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
In April of 1897, her last sickness began. By May, she was unable to participate in community exercises and was at times suspected by her fellow sisters of exaggerating her illness. In addition, she wrestled with a growing sense of separation from God. In this suffering, it would have been easy to become frustrated with her lowliness. Yet Therese embraced her littleness, saying:
                        <br><br>
“On being discharged from all my duties, I have been impressed by the thought that my death will not cause the least inconvenience in the community.”
                        <br><br>
Most people would be upset about being dispensable, but Therese didn’t see it that way. She didn’t worry about her insignificance because she knew anything good she did came from God. And being only His instrument, she readily acknowledged the other sisters could serve His purposes just as well. 
                        <br><br>
Therese had absorbed the truth of Jesus’s teaching that “apart from me you can do nothing.” (Jn 15:5) She accepted that He was all and she was nothing.
                        <br><br>
Further, in striving to cultivate humility St. Therese sought to hide her sufferings and virtues, so only God would witness them. She succeeded in this aim so completely that a fellow sister reportedly said:
                        <br><br>
“I do not see why anyone speaks of Sister Thérèse of the Child Jesus as a saint. She has practiced virtue, it is true, but not a virtue acquired through suffering and humiliation.” (NV 67)
                        <br><br>
The value of hiding sufferings and virtues for Therese was twofold: First, it allowed her to focus only on pleasing God and mortify her vanity. And Second, it permitted her to imitate Christ as the suffering servant described by Isaiah:
                        <br><br>
“he had no beauty that we should desire him. He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief; and as one from whom men hide their faces, he was despised and we esteemed him not.”
                        <br><br>
Humility is at the core of St. Therese’s entire spiritual approach and is unveiled by her illness. But humility alone might have left her discouraged, if not for her great Confidence in God.
                        <br><br>

In June of 1897, St. Therese’s illness worsened and she was unable to stand without the help of others. Her spiritual temptations promised her death would be followed by nothingness and her ever reliable hope was gone. Yet, in her tremendous confidence she longed for death and heaven thereafter. 
                        <br><br>
When the chaplain asked her if she was resigned to die, Therese responded:
                        <br><br>
“Ah, Father, I find that I need rather to be resigned to live. I experience, on the other hand, only joy at the thought of death.”
                        <br><br>
Despite the atheistic temptations she suffered, her confidence in God was so strong that she longed for death. But what was the source of this Confidence?
                        <br><br>
Perhaps the greatest source was her recognition of the merciful loving character of God as the perfect Father.
Therese received the grace to be raised by a saintly father, Louis Martin, who along with his wife Zélie were the first married couple to be canonized together as saints. And it was this father who helped instill in St. Therese immense filial trust. A filial trust that naturally extended to God as the perfect father.
                        <br><br>
And St. Therese’s conviction of God as the perfect father even changed how she saw his justice, writing to a missionary priest she advised, she said:
                        <br><br>
“It is this justice which frightens so many souls which is the subject of my joy and my trust. To be just is not only to exercise severity to punish the guilty, it is also to recognize right intentions and to reward virtue.”
                        <br><br>
God recognizes the weakness of human nature, or as St. Therese said, “He remembers that we are only dust.” And because he knows of man’s weakness, to be perfectly just is to take this weakness into account when judging his children. And in this way, Therese sees how God’s mercy is imbued even into his justice.
                        <br><br>
And this knowledge of God is what allows St. Therese to have complete confidence in Him. However, as her illness wore on, the next aspect of her “little way” would become increasingly important:
                        <br><br>
Patience
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
In July of 1897, St. Therese’s illness continued its downward progression: she struggled to sleep, had fits of suffocation, and frequently coughed up blood. She was so weak that she could no longer write her autobiography with pen and switched to pencil. Spiritually, she felt Heaven was closed to her and fought to believe. But rather than wishing for a quick end to this suffering, she was content to wait for God’s timing. 
She says:
                        <br><br>
“Just as I have been obliged to practice patience while awaiting all the other great events of my life, so is it now in my expectation of death. I entered Carmel young, and yet…there was a three months’ delay; for receiving the habit there was a similar delay; for my profession, another postponement! Very well, for my death it will be the same…” (NV 28-29)
                        <br><br>
And although she longed to receive Extreme Unction, she was content to wait for God’s timing there as well. Pauline describes that when Father Superior came to decide about administering Extreme Unction, St. Therese was so cheerful and agreeable (in spite of her suffering) that they decided not to give her the Sacrament she so yearned to receive.
                        <br><br>
Although she failed to receive the Last Sacrament on the 9th, on July 30th God willed to give it to her.  That day she was coughing up blood all day and had to be given ether to help her breathe. As she finally received the Sacrament, all the details were being prepared in the next room for her burial. But on the next day, she was back to her normal level of sickness. Each time she felt as though the Divine Thief was finally in sight, he disappeared.
                        <br><br>
St. Therese’s patience allowed her to suffer without a clear end in sight and wait for God’s timing. But the next aspect of her “little way” allowed her to love her suffering.
                        <br><br>
Abandonment to God’s Will.
                        <br><br>

                        <br><br>
By August of 1897, St. Therese’s illness was worse than ever; When examined after the Feast of the Assumption the doctor said “the right lung is completely gone… she is very emaciated… the tuberculosis has reached its final stage.” Spiritually she fared no better and in a single night constantly made acts of faith in opposition to the incessant temptations assaulting her.
                        <br><br>
And yet, she didn’t seek to get away from this suffering for one second. When Pauline lamented that her prayers for Therese’s to suffer less had not been answered.
                        <br><br>
Therese responded: “I have asked God not to hear the prayers that would place an obstacle to the accomplishment of His designs upon me. . . .”
                        <br><br>
In her Abandonment to God’s will, Therese sought not to escape the sufferings that assaulted her constantly, instead she longed for whatever God sent, saying about her terrible suffering:
                        <br><br>
“I love it! I love whatsoever God gives me.”
                        <br><br>
Her love of suffering sprung from her love of God and her knowledge of His goodness. She knew whatever He willed for her was part of His plan of goodness. Thus, each suffering was a grace that allowed her to participate in this plan.
                        <br><br>
For this reason, she didn’t want to miss out on even the smallest of these opportunities whether it was shoulder pain or eating food she found loathsome. Influenced heavily by St. John of the Cross, she surely remembered when he said:
                        <br><br>
“The smallest act of pure love is of more value to God than all other works together.”
                        <br><br>
And St. Therese wanted to demonstrate her profound love of God with every act she performed. This love, which is the final aspect of her “little way”, is the foundation of all the other aspects. And it was this love that carried her through the prolonged suffering of her final trial and brought her to the last days of her worldly pilgrimage.
                        <br><br>

By the end of September, St. Therese’s suffering was near its peak: she had a painful rattling in her throat, she was so thin that she called herself a “skeleton”, and she increasingly struggled to breathe. Spiritually, she received no respite from her difficulties, and at one point admitted she was receiving no consolation, but only “pure agony.”
                        <br><br>
And yet, this suffering was what she wanted. 
                        <br><br>
In her Act of Oblation to Merciful Love, St. Therese prayed:
                        <br><br>
“It is with joy I shall contemplate You on the Last Day carrying the scepter of Your Cross. Since You deigned to give me a share in this very precious Cross, I hope in heaven to resemble You… I want to work for Your love alone with the one purpose of pleasing You, consoling Your Sacred Heart, and saving souls who will love You eternally.”
                        <br><br>
Because of her love, St. Therese’s greatest desires were to resemble Jesus, to please Him, and to make Him more loved. And it is in her suffering that she is able to achieve all three of these desires.
                        <br><br>
Through suffering: she can resemble Him in His passion, she can please Him by suffering joyfully out of love, and she can make Him more loved by offering her suffering for the sake of souls. 
                        <br><br>
With suffering being the key that unlocks her greatest desires, how could it be anything but sweet to her?
                        <br><br>
She affirms this sentiment, on the day of her death, saying:
                        <br><br>
“Everything I have written about my desires for suffering. Oh! It is true just the same. I’m not sorry for having surrendered myself to love…on the contrary.”
                        <br><br>
That day, at around five in the evening, St. Thérèse’s agony began. The sisters gathered as she held her crucifix, her eyes fixed on it. Her breathing grew labored, her body trembled, and sweat poured from her forehead. When the Angelus rang at six, Thérèse raised her eyes pleadingly to the statue of the Virgin Mary. Shortly after seven, the Prioress, thinking the end was not near, dismissed the community.
                        <br><br>
Thérèse sighed and said: “Oh! Mother, is it not yet the agony? Am I not going to die?” 
                        <br><br>
“Yes, my child, it is the agony; but perhaps the good God wills to prolong it for some hours.” 
                        <br><br>
“Ah, well! . . . So be it; so be it! . . . Oh! I do not wish to suffer less.” 
                        <br><br>
Then, looking at her crucifix she said: “Oh! . . . I love Him! . . . My God! . . . I . . . love . . . Thee!”
                        <br><br>
—
                        <br><br>
These were St. Therese’s last words. And as the prioress rushed to call the community back to her bedside, Therese’s gaze turned to the heavens and expressed a happiness that surpassed all her desires.
                        <br><br>
No one can say what she saw in those last moments, but given the explosive popularity of her autobiography after her death, maybe God confirmed that her mission “to teach [her] little way to souls” was indeed about to begin.
But if her little way is to spread as it ought, Catholics must look past the misunderstandings surrounding her to the truth revealed in her final illness: far from being childish, at twenty-four she was theologically mature; anything but sentimental, she abandoned herself through great sufferings; in no way choosing an easy path, her way demanded her whole self.
                        <br><br>
And the Church has affirmed St. Therese’s little way at every turn. Each successive pope has extolled her teaching. And Pope St. John Paul II even called her way “nothing other than the Gospel way of holiness for all”.
Hers is a path suitable for every Catholic. A path of humility, confidence, patience, abandonment, and love.
                        <br><br>
A path to Jesus.
