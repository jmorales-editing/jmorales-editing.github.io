		                    <p class="lead">I grew up in a Sunday-Mass home, we attended mass weekly, but we didn't pray, read scripture, or truly follow after Christ. So when I entered a rebellious phase as a teen, the natural place to rebel was against the traditions that no one seemed to take very seriously. I stopped going to mass at around thirteen years old and became a child of the world.<br><br>But God, in His infinite goodness, had compassion on me, and while I continually struggled and suffered much outside of His care, His loving hand never left me, and He slowly drew me back to Himself. Although my idea of morality was corrupted by my own self-will, God continually showed me examples of Christians who lived in a higher way than me.<br><br>Finally, in spring of 2023, God gave me the grace to attend a small non-denominational service. This first sermon and worship music stirred my soul with consolation and I began attending regularly. I joined a bible study and met some people who were truly committed to living out the message of Charity toward their neighbors. They were so kind to me and showed me such love, but in December of 2023, I started feeling the pull toward tradition.<br><br>Knowing my baggage toward Catholicism, God showed His patience once again and exposed me first to Eastern Orthodoxy. He showed me the beauty of traditions stretching back since the time of Christ, and I found I agreed more and more with the Orthodox teachings rather than the Southern Baptist teachings of my bible study family. But this factual assent was not all God gave me, He also placed in my soul a longing for the Sacraments and especially the Holy Eucharist.<br><br>I didn't want to stop going to church with my non-denominational friends, and struggled with going back and forth on this decision for months. But eventually the pull toward the Sacraments was too strong and I attended a Greek Orthodox Divine Liturgy. The Liturgy itself was very beautiful, but the community was much older than me and culturally Greek. I felt like an outsider. With this option looking less appealing in my mind, God was ready to draw me toward His Church.<br><br>At this time, God gave me the grace to encounter more Catholic sources (Father Mike Schmitz, Brian Holdsworth, Matt Fradd, and others). Hearing the clarity with which these Catholics spoke reminded me very much of the Eastern Orthodox speakers I'd heard. I was still skeptical when they spoke of the Catholic Church being the Church Christ founded, but the little seeds God sowed through them landed in the fertile soil of a soul longing for the Eucharist. And soon I decided to attend mass for the first time in fifteen years.<br><br>As I sat down in one of the pews, my heart was split in three directions. There was Eastern Orthodoxy with its appeal of a very reverent liturgy. There were the wonderful Protestant friends and their familial environment. And sitting among a large parish of young families, undergrad and graduate students, middle-aged parents and their teens, and white-haired elders, the draw back to the Church grew stronger. I was so unsure of what to do, so I took the advice from a video I’d watched and prayed.<br><br>I asked God for a sign of whether or not I should keep giving the Catholic Church a chance. And during mass I got it.<br><br>More than ever before, I felt that God was present with us. And God sought to stir my soul in many ways during this mass: the stunning domed architecture captured my imagination, the traditional choir sang beautiful chants and hymns, and the incense floated toward the heavens carrying our prayers to the Father. But most of all, as the priest said the words of consecration, my eyes were glued to the little host being raised in his hands.<br><br>My Lord and my God.<br><br>The next Saturday, I went to my first confession in twenty years. And the following Sunday, in April 2024, I was reunited with Jesus in the Eucharist for the first time in fifteen years. Since then I've delved deeply into apologetics to strengthen my faith, have cultivated a relationship with the Blessed Virgin Mary through Marian Consecration, have completed Father Mike's Catechism in the Year, have read through the bible for the first time, have read many spiritual classics like "Introduction to the Devout Life", "Story of a Soul", and "True Devotion to Mary", and was finally brought into full communion with the Church through my Confirmation last Easter.<br><br>The Lord is truly gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love. He has given me an abundance of grace to turn back toward Him. And now, He has placed in my soul, the desire to do work that serves His Church. And if you share this desire, I would love to speak to you about any way you think I could help you!</p>

		                    <h3 class="uppercase color-primary mb40 mb-xs-24">Called to Serve in a Different way</h3>
		                    <p class="lead">As I first returned to Protestant
                        Christianity, then Catholicism, my approach toward my
                        work began to change.<br><br>My previous experience had
                        been with secular clients, and I still had
                        opportunities in that space. But as my faith deepened,
                        I started to feel uneasy with the kinds of projects
                        I was being asked to work on.&nbsp; At the same time,
                        I began to feel drawn toward religious life, putting my
                        creative skills directly to use in service of the
                        Church as a religious brother.<br><br>So instead of
                        striving to land more work, I stepped back. I gave more
                        space to prayer and focused intently on my spiritual
                        life, trying to discern where God was leading
                        me.<br><br>Over time, I started to see that my desire
                        for religious life may have been mixed with a desire to
                        retreat from some of the responsibilities I have in the
                        world. I came to see that God wanted me in the world,
                        but in a different way than before.<br><br>I realized
                        that media today is not morally neutral, that there are
                        always ideologies and philosophical assumptions
                        underlying the messages people produce.&nbsp;And I knew
                        I could no longer be part of creating content that
                        subtly affirms a worldview I no longer share.<br><br>So
                        now, turning away from my secular work, I'm focusing on
                        working with Catholic clients—people and organizations
                        trying to share truth, beauty, and goodness through the
                        media they make. And by helping these clients create
                        faithful, meaningful, and well-crafted content, I will
                        be able to serve the Church founded by Jesus
                        Christ.<br><br>If you are a Catholic wanting to level up
                        your video content or seeking to help this content
                        reach more people, I would love to discuss how I can
                        help you.</p>
